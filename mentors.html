             <td class="tick-border">Alex is currently one of the three youth coaches of the FLL robotics team,
             Ctrl-Z Bayview Glen.  Prior to holding this position, he was a member of the Ctrl-Z
             team for 4 years.  During his time on Ctrl-Z, he had the opportunity to compete in 2 FIRST
             Championships in St. Louis, the International Open in Toronto, and the North American Open Championship
             in San Diego, California.  Being in FLL has taught Alex to better public speak and to teach
             students more effectively which he hopes to apply to help Ctrl-Z succeed this season.  Outside
             of robotics, he likes to play badminton, Scrabble, bike with his friends and play with LEGO.

Justin is one of Ctrl-Z’s youth coaches and is currently a Grade 12 student at Bayview Glen.  As a member of Ctrl-Z from 2008-2014, he competed in two
World Festivals and two International Opens.  After his 2014 retirement from FLL, he became the coach of Gryphonbots, leading them to a 3rd place
finish at the Ontario East Provincial Championships.  This season, Justin looks forward to coaching Ctrl-Z and helping each team member achieve his or her
own goals.  Aside from coaching Ctrl-Z, Justin spends his spare time playing sports (like volleyball and tennis), instructing skiing and reading.

Christopher is one of the enthusiastic coaches of Ctrl-Z. Before this season, he was a Ctrl-Z team member for four extraordinary seasons: Food Factor,
Senior Solutions, Nature’s Fury, and World Class. As part of the team, he has learned to better manage his time, collaborate with others, and effectively
share ideas with others. He looks forward to promoting FLL, spreading his knowledge to the new team members, and helping the team on its journey from 
start to finish. Outside of robotics, he enjoys reading, building with LEGO, and studying.
