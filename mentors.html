             <td class="tick-border">Mr. Mark is currently one of the three coaches of the FLL robotics team,
             Ctrl-Z from Bayview Glen School.  Prior to having this position, he was a member of the Ctrl-Z 
             team for 4 years.  During his time in FLL, he had the opportunity to compete in 2 FLL World 
             Championships in St. Louis, an International Open in Toronto, and a North American Open Championship
             in LEGOLAND, California.  Being in FLL has taught Mr. Mark to better public speak and to teach 
             students more effectively which he hopes to apply to help Ctrl-Z succeed this season.  Outside
             of robotics, he likes to play badminton, Scrabble, bike with his friends and play with LEGO.

Justin is one of Ctrl-Zâ€™s coaches and is currently a Grade 12 student at Bayview Glen.  As a member of Ctrl-Z from 2008-2014, he competed in two
World Festivals and two International Opens.  After his 2014 retirement from FLL, he became the coach of Gryphonbots, coaching them to a 3rd place
finish at the Ontario East Provincials Championship.  This season, Justin looks forward to coaching Ctrl-Z and helping each team member achieve their 
own goals.  Aside from coaching Ctrl-Z, Justin spends his spare time playing sports (like volleyball and tennis), instructing skiing and reading.
