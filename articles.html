<h5>Garbology-Difference Engine : Talking trash</h5>
<ul>
<li>The first paragraph is about the incinerator in Toy Story 3</li>
	<ul>
		<li>If, in real life, the plant had been built prior to 1989, the plastic toys would have produced a nasty dose of dioxins and furans</li>
        <ul>
        <li>Dioxins-”A highly toxic compound produced as a by-product in some manufacturing processes, notably herbicide production and paper bleaching. It is a serious and persistent environmental pollutant. A heterocyclic organochlorine compound; alternative name: 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin (abbreviation: TCDD) ; chemical formula: C12H4O2Cl4”</li>
        <li>Furans-”A colourless volatile liquid with a planar unsaturated five-membered ring in its molecule. Chemical formula: C4H4O”</li>
        <li>Another way of stating that would be “toxic emissions from combustion taking place in the present of chlorine”</li>
   		</ul>
   	<li>Before then, few people were aware that such chemicals were a serious health hazard</li>
    </ul>
<li>The second paragraph was about emissions and the environment</li>
<ul>
<li>“Industry subsequently spent billions retrofitting incinerators with activated-carbon injections”</li>
<li>“Thanks to new regulations, the emission of such toxic chemicals from waste processing has been reduced a thousandfold”</li>
</ul>
<li>The third paragraph is about municipal incinerators</li>
<ul>
<li>“In America, most communities prefer their waste to be composted”</li>
<li>“The landfills are nowhere near their own backyards”</li>
</ul>
<li>The fourth paragraph is about landfills</li>
<ul>
<li>“Puente Hills Landfill in Los Angeles, the largest of the 1,900 municipal landfills in America, is over 500-feet high”</li>
<li>This landfill can generate electricity for 70,000 homes with its methane that it produces</li>
</ul>
<li>The fifth paragraph is about transporting garbage</li>
<ul>
<li>NYC transports most of its garbage by truck</li>
</ul>
<li>The sixth paragraph is about how landfill shortage is a big issue</li>
<ul>
<li>In China they are running out of space for landfills</li>
<li>Although using incinerators is awful for the environment, officials are now having to reconsider the issue of incineration to the non-stop increase of landfill space</li>
<li>WTE plants are saying that they have their incinerators burning at 850oC, which breaks down the molecular bonds in dioxins and other toxic chemicals, basically stating that having the incinerator at that heat is harmless</li>
<li>Also, “the flue gasses are then cooled in heat exchangers that raise steam to drive the electricity-generating turbines”</li>
<ul>
<li>flue gases-"A mixture of gases produced by the burning of fuel or other materials in power stations and industrial plants and extracted via ducts"
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>The seventh paragraph is more about flue gases</li>
<ul>
	<li>In order to remove sulphur dioxide as well as various acids and heavy metals from flue gases, the flue gas have to go through a cleaning system that filters fine particles from the flow and then scrubs the gas</li>
</ul></ul>
