<!--Garbology-->
<h4>Garbology-Difference Engine: Talking trash</h4>
<ul>
<li>The first paragraph is about the incinerator in Toy Story 3</li>
	<ul>
		<li>If, in real life, the plant had been built prior to 1989, the plastic toys would have produced a nasty dose of dioxins and furans</li>
        <ul>
        <li>Dioxins-”A highly toxic compound produced as a by-product in some manufacturing processes, notably herbicide production and paper bleaching. It is a serious and persistent environmental pollutant. A heterocyclic organochlorine compound; alternative name: 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin (abbreviation: TCDD) ; chemical formula: C12H4O2Cl4”</li>
        <li>Furans-”A colourless volatile liquid with a planar unsaturated five-membered ring in its molecule. Chemical formula: C4H4O”</li>
        <li>Another way of stating that would be “toxic emissions from combustion taking place in the present of chlorine”</li>
   		</ul>
   	<li>Before then, few people were aware that such chemicals were a serious health hazard</li>
    </ul>
<li>The second paragraph was about emissions and the environment</li>
<ul>
<li>“Industry subsequently spent billions retrofitting incinerators with activated-carbon injections”</li>
<li>“Thanks to new regulations, the emission of such toxic chemicals from waste processing has been reduced a thousandfold”</li>
</ul>
<li>The third paragraph is about municipal incinerators</li>
<ul>
<li>“In America, most communities prefer their waste to be composted”</li>
<li>“The landfills are nowhere near their own backyards”</li>
</ul>
<li>The fourth paragraph is about landfills</li>
<ul>
<li>“Puente Hills Landfill in Los Angeles, the largest of the 1,900 municipal landfills in America, is over 500-feet high”</li>
<li>This landfill can generate electricity for 70,000 homes with its methane that it produces</li>
</ul>
<li>The fifth paragraph is about transporting garbage</li>
<ul>
<li>NYC transports most of its garbage by truck</li>
</ul>
<li>The sixth paragraph is about how landfill shortage is a big issue</li>
<ul>
<li>In China they are running out of space for landfills</li>
<li>Although using incinerators is awful for the environment, officials are now having to reconsider the issue of incineration to the non-stop increase of landfill space</li>
<li>WTE plants are saying that they have their incinerators burning at 850oC, which breaks down the molecular bonds in dioxins and other toxic chemicals, basically stating that having the incinerator at that heat is harmless</li>
<li>Also, “the flue gasses are then cooled in heat exchangers that raise steam to drive the electricity-generating turbines”</li>
<ul>
<li>flue gases-"A mixture of gases produced by the burning of fuel or other materials in power stations and industrial plants and extracted via ducts"
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>The seventh paragraph is more about flue gases</li>
<ul>
	<li>In order to remove sulphur dioxide as well as various acids and heavy metals from flue gases, the flue gas have to go through a cleaning system that filters fine particles from the flow and then scrubs the gas</li>
</ul></ul>

<!--Zero Waste Recycle Every Material-->

<h4>Zero Waste: Recycle Every Material (An article about TerraCycle)</h4>

<ul>
<li>What TerraCycle offers:</li>
	<ul>
    <li>TerraCycle Canada is the local version of a global company that has repurposed more than 2.6 billion pieces of food and beverage, office and school supply, e-waste and other hard-to-recycle streams</li>
    <ul>
    <li>These collections have raised more than US $8 mil. dollars for charity through its various packaging reclamation programs</li>
    </ul>
    <li>TerraCycle will offer the first of 25 markets in which the international company operates to offer a curbside pickup of its recycling programs</li>
    </ul>
 </ul>


<!--Recycling The Hard Stuff-->

<h4>Recycling The Hard Stuff</h4>
<ul>
<li>22.4 million tons of plastics produced in the United States in 1998, only about 5.4 percent were recovered for recycling</li>
<li>
Plastics used in durable goods (such as cars, electronics, and appliances) account for the largest proportion by weight of plastics in U.S. municipal solid waste (MSW)
</li>
<li>
Plastics are difficult to separate and therefore hard to recycle
</li>
<li>
Separating the plastics can limit the recycling rate
</li>
<li>
Products often contain as many as 20 different types of plastic materials as well as non-plastic materials such as wood, rubber, glass, and fibers
</li>
<li>
 Operation costs for processing recycled plastics are estimated in the range of 10-20 cents per pound
 </li>
 <li>
 Recycled plastic resin is competitive with costs for existing virgin plastics
 </li>
 <li>
The incinerators are used to burn up garbage but are creating pollution to the environment and also the heat made by the fire is used to create energy
</li>
<li>
About 50% of the people in Toronto recycle things properly
</li>
<li>
Compost is mostly contaminated with recycling therefore making the “once recyclable” things not recyclable
</li>
</ul>

<!--Less Is More-->

<h4>Less Is More</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Sieben Linden is one of the fastest growing towns in Germany yet it is made completely out wood, straw, and mud which is very eco-friendly
</li>
<li>
Growing your own food and owning less dramatically reduces waste
</li>
<li>
It is possible to live green without sacrifice
</li>
<li>
In the last 20 years the amount of waste made is increasing by 3 percent each year
</li>
<li>
Collecting garbage less often will make you throw away less
</li>
<li>
Making people pay per amount of garbage is a solution
</li>
<li>
Soda cans are half as thick as they were 40 years ago showing that we are trying to improve package size
</li>
<li>
HP’s laptops are 90% recyclable
</li>
<li>
There are still many opportunities to improve in electronic waste
</li>
<li>
Making companies pay for greenhouse gasses can also reduce waste
</li>
</ul>
