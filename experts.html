Lauren attended York University's francophone Glendon Campus from 2010 to 2011 before transferring to Wilfrid 
Laurier University to pursue an Honours Bachelor of Arts degree in Communications Studies, which she obtained in 2014. 
During her time at Wilfrid Laurier University, Lauren sat on a committee of students as a marketing advisor to the

2014 as an Administrative Assistant where she obtained a wealth of knowledge about recycling systems and processes,

research papers published in an academic journal. While completing her degree, Lauren took a specific interest in the 
theories of moral panic and the notion of a risk society. Her research, which has been cited by medical officials, 
government organizations and academics around the world, explores the complex interactions between corporations, 
policies, news media, marketing strategies and scientific research to cultivate moral panic in a 
socially-perceived risky society.
