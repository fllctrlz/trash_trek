             	On December 2, 2015, we met as a team with Anne Sneyd, Director of Brokerage and Shipping at Canada 
             	Fibers Ltd. Anne has been working with Canada Fibres Ltd. for 9 years, and passed some of the knowledge
             	she had gained about recycling in those 9 years on to us. She enlightened us on what Canada Fibres Ltd.
             	is, how their facility operates, and gave us some useful information about the recycling stream, and 
             	how recycled materials are processed. We are thankful to Anne for sharing her knowledge with us, and 
             	providing us with feedback on our prototype. She informed us about the educational aspect of our trash 
             	bin and commented on how our bin helps the user learn where various waste items belong.

             	fibers, compost and glass, to having it also sort the items by their brand name. This

             	Since 2006, Jim has been the President and CEO of Packaging Consortium (PAC),

             	through the ranks of Packaging Systems. This led to Vice Presidential roles of business units and
             	ultimately to divisional President and CEO. On Wednesday November 11th  Ctrl-Z met with Mr. Downham
             	at our school Bayview Glen. He explained that PAC focuses on packaging waste, working with companies
             	and educating consumers to create a world without packaging waste. We learned about how waste is 
             	collected and sorted and that contamination of recyclable materials recovered in a MRF (Municipal
             	Recovery Facility) causes most valuable materials to be diverted to landfills. Recovery rates are 
             	very low because most people do not care about recycling and it is difficult to sort different 
             	types of materials. He also pointed out that 33 % of all food is thrown out or wasted.
