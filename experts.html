             	Lauren Camara currently serves as Communications Specialist with Canada Fibers/Urban Resource Group. 
             	In this role, she drives internal communications and external marketing initiatives for Canada Fibers
             	and its subsidiary company, Urban Resource Group.<br> 
Lauren attended York University's francophone Glendon Campus from 2010 to 2011 before transferring to Wilfrid 
Laurier University to pursue an Honours Bachelor of Arts degree in Communications Studies, which she obtained in 2014. 
During her time at Wilfrid Laurier University, Lauren sat on a committee of students as a marketing advisor to the 
faculty of arts and wrote editorials and columns for an NGO’s national website. She joined Canada Fibers in June 
2014 as an Administrative Assistant where she obtained a wealth of knowledge about recycling systems and processes, 
and learned about the various challenges and opportunities facing the recycling industry. In June 2015, Lauren was 
promoted to the Marketing and Corporate Communications Department where she was part of the team that spearheaded 
the marketing efforts to announce Canada Fibers' subsidiary company, Urban Resource Group. Since that time, 
Lauren has worked to drive internal and external communications and marketing initiatives as Communications Specialist.<br>
In addition to Lauren’s professional accomplishments, she is also a published researcher, with one of her senior academic 
research papers published in an academic journal. While completing her degree, Lauren took a specific interest in the 
theories of moral panic and the notion of a risk society. Her research, which has been cited by medical officials, 
government organizations and academics around the world, explores the complex interactions between corporations, 
policies, news media, marketing strategies and scientific research to cultivate moral panic in a 
socially-perceived risky society.
