<h4>James D Downham, President & CEO, PAC, Packaging Consortium</h4>

<h5>November 11th, just after the idea of the Smart Sort Trash Bin</h5>

<p><b>Since 2006 Jim Downham has been advancing the packaging industry 
agenda as the President & CEO for the not-for-profit, PAC, Packaging 
Consortium.  Prior to PAC Jim spent his career in the manufacturing
 of package materials/containers rising to the level of CEO of a $175
 million multi-plant North American packaging leader. In 2000 Jim founded 
 LeaderLinx, a packaging industry consultant.  In November 2014 Jim
 reached the pinnacle of his career when he was inducted into the
 Packaging Hall of Fame in Chicago, Illinois
 </b>
 </p>
 <br>
 <p>Since 2010, PAC has taken a path of social responsibility.  
 Focus on:</p>
 <br>
 <ul>
 
<li>Packaging – PACNext – a world without packaging waste.</li>
<li>Food Waste – 33% of all food is wasted.</li>
<li>Canadian Water Summit – water waste.</li>

</ul>
<br>
<p>About PAC</P>

<ul>

<li>Common theme is packaging.</li>
<li>Organization educates on all subjects related to packaging, including factory tours and classroom education.</li>
<li>PAC works with major retails, who are members of the organization.</li>
<li>Members include companies at all points of the value chain, like Kraft, Coca Cola and packaging companies.</li>
<li>And now waste management companies and governments are members of PAC.</li>
<li>According to Jim Downham, the way to solve a problem is with collaboration and discussion.</li>
<li>PacNext, formed in 2010, resulted in having to learn a whole new industry.</li>

</ul>
<br>

<p>Comments on Ctrl-Z’s intelligent waste and recycling receptacle:</p>
<li>Jim Downham recently saw a bin at Sherway Garden with descriptions which were very helpful.</li>
<li>He introduced the idea of “Circular Economy” -  an alternative to a traditional linear economy (make, use, dispose) in which we keep resources in use for as long as possible, extract the maximum value from them whilst in use, then recover and regenerate products and materials at the end of each service life.</li>
<li>He referred to Ellen MacArthur, a pioneer in circular economy movement who is a retired British sailor.  She learned to go a long way and understood the need to be self-reliant.  </li>
<li>We are a consumption society (i.e. we throw stuff away).</li>
<li>Nature’s Path is in the business of getting a bowl of cereal in front of you.</li>
<li>We generate so much waste.</li>
<li>But anything made can be brought back and made into something else.</li>
<li>To achieve a world without packaging waste is a huge task.</li>

</ul>

<br>

<p>Food service waste:</p>
<ul>
<li>CBC’s Marketplace – used GPS trackers on Tim Hortons Inc. waste.</li>
<li>Complex issues.</li>
<li>QSRs are small and there is not much space to store waste and recycling.</li>
<li>The problem is that waste is combined.</li>
<li>Problem is that packaging is being contaminated with food – a huge problem because such packaging cannot be recycled.</li>
<li>In order to be sustainable, profit must be generated.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<p>Reasons for not recycling:</p>

<ul>
<li>Consumers litter.</li>
<li>Many people do not care about recycling.</li>
<li>With condominium apartments it is difficult to sort various types of rubbish.</li>
<li>Food contamination of packaging materials.</li>
<li>Municipal Recovery Facility (“MRF”):</li>
<li>Newspaper and old corrugated cardboard (“OCC”) is the most commonly recycled material with 60%-80% recovery rates.</li>
<li>Only a small % of aluminum cans are recycled.</li>
<li>Clear glass is good for recycling but colored glass is bad.</li>
<li>Plastic bottles recycle well.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>The packaging material which is growing the most is flexible packaging (e.g. potato chip bags, meat and cheese packaging).</p>
<ul>
<li>This is difficult to sort at the MRF.</li>
<li>They consist of laminated materials and structures.</li>
<li>Nylon laminated with polypropylene cannot be separated.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Jim Downham introduced the concept of “Extended Producer Responsibility”, strategy designed to promote the integration of environmental costs associated with goods throughout their life cycles into the market price of the products.</p>
<ul>
<li>You pay for the recovery of your product (e.g. Snapple)</li>
<ul>
<br>
<p>What gets in the way of increased recovery?:</p>
<ul>
<li>Laws (provincial)</li>
<li>Method of recovery (municipal)</li>
<li>Consumer (put it in, or not)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Jim Downham discussed Stewardship Ontario, a not-for-profit organization funded and governed by the industries that are the brand owners, first importers or franchisors of the products and packaging materials managed under its recycling programs. It operates the Blue Box – the curbside recycling program for printed paper and packaging, and Orange Drop – the recycling and safe disposal program for hazardous or special waste.</p>
<ul>
<li>The cost of Stewardship Ontario compliance  for product manufacturers is approximately 2% to 3% of cost of sales.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li>The weight of the package is an issue for recycling.  The solution is lightweight flexible packaging.</li>
<li>Need to look at the start to the finish to see what has the smallest environmental impact.</li>
<li>Bioplastics are evolving very rapidly.</li>
<li>Jim Downham referred to team to Ecologic Brands which forms bottles out of paper.  Easy to decouple paper from the plastic.</li>
<li>Jim Downham referred the team to Recyclebank which rewards people for taking everyday green actions with discounts and deals from local and national businesses.</li>
<li>He referred the team to TerraCycle, a company that makes consumer products from waste, formed by Tom Szaky.</li>
<li>An interesting idea at Wal-Mart is a drop off depot at the corner of the parking lot which gives people credits which can be used inside the store.</li>
<li>Beer bottles get recycled 13 times before disposed of.</li>
<li>GreenMantra is a technology company that has developed a proprietary catalytic process to economically produce commercial quality waxes and fuels.  It uses polymers to make wax which is used in roofing shingles.</li>
<li>He encouraged us to examine the K-cups Lifecycle Assessment – for single serve coffee pods.  Maybe make a pod out of bioplastic.</li>
